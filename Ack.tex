I cannot express enough thanks to the members of this thesis committee: Dr. Rodrigo Huerta Quintanilla and Dr. Román Castro Rodriguez.

The completion of this project could not have been accomplished without the support of my supervisor, Jesus Guillermo Contreras Nuño; and so many people at CERN specially Frank Zimmermann.

I thank Consejo de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) and CINVESTAV for the financial support during my masters studies. I also thank CERN for all the information they make available to students such as myself.

I also want to thank the administrative personnel from CINVESTAV Mérida which has been helpful and efficient, specially Dr. Gerko Oskam and Zhirnay Rodriguez Pinelo.
