Particle accelerators are machines whose name is self explanatory, and were
originally developed for nuclear physics. Although we could argue that a
cathodic tube is an accelerator itself, we count as the first accelerator one
that was designed, after Rutherford challenged the scientific community in 1927
to accelerate charged particles to energies higher \cite{Steere2005timeline}
