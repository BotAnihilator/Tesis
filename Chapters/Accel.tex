Particle accelerators are machines whose name is self explanatory. They were
originally developed for nuclear physics. Although we could argue that a
cathodic tube is an accelerator itself, we count as the first accelerator one
that was designed, after Rutherford challenged the scientific community in 1927
to accelerate charged particles to energies higher than natural
$\alpha$-decays\cite{Steere2005timeline}, which have a typical energy of
\SI{5}{MeV}. This accelerator was the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier, which was used to produce the first ever reported nuclear fission. The original setup
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cock}. It consisted of an AC power source charging a
ladder of capacitors by means of diodes, generating a large voltage
output\cite{Cockcroft619}. Following the relation between the electric field
($\vec{E}$) and the scalar potential ($V$): $\vec{E}=-\nabla{V}$ and equating
Newton's second law of motion ($\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$) to the Lorentz force
($\vec{F}=q(\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$) we infer that the acceleration in an
electrostatic accelerator such as the Cockcroft-Walton is:
$\vec{a}=-\frac{q}{m}\nabla{}V$. Ever since, accelerators have not stopped
evolving. Scientists kept building larger and larger accelerators until they hit
a limit with electrostatic fields due to voltage breakdown\cite{EASTHAM198410}.

A new technique for accelerating charges emerged. Already in 1924 Gustav Ising had proposed
using drift tubes to shield the charged particle from a pulsed voltage\cite{Ising}, and in
1928 Rolf  Wider\"oe suggested  using a radiofrequency (RF) system
\cite{Wideroe1928}. To prove this principle  Wider\"oe built the first
linear accelerator or linac,  and RF acceleration was born.

Using the RF acceleration principle, Ernest Lawrence set electrons
in a curved path by applying a perpendicular magnetic field so that the
electrons would pass several times through and accelerating gap. Figure
\ref{fig:cyclo} shows Lawrence drawings in his 1934 patent and
Fig. \ref{fig:lawrence} we see Lawrence standing next to his \SI{1.5}{m}
diameter cyclotron in the University of California at Berkeley.
