\section{Simulation}
We ran \srthree which was described in chapter \ref{soft}. Our aim was to simulate ten thousand photons, but because of technical challenges mentioned in subsection \ref{lxplus}, we divided the simulation into smaller simulations with a much smaller number of photons, there were simulations with 10, 20 and 50 photons each, which we can join together because photons do not interact with each other.

\subsection{SMIF}
The SMIF used to run this simulations used the following parameters. \ref{smif}
The simulations started at element 142 and ended at element 146,  positive direction was choosen as if we were analizing Beam 1.
