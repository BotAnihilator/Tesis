abstract="The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) presently provides proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass (c.m.) energy of 13 TeV. The LHC design was started more than 30 years ago, and its physics program will extend through the second half of the 2030's. The global Future Circular Collider (FCC) study is now preparing for a post-LHC project. The FCC study focuses on the design of a 100-TeV hadron collider (FCC-hh) in a new ∼100 km tunnel. It also includes the design of a high-luminosity electron-positron collider (FCCee) as a potential intermediate step, and a lepton-hadron collider option (FCC-he). The scope of the FCC study comprises accelerators, technology, infrastructure, detectors, physics, concepts for worldwide data services, international governance models, and implementation scenarios. Among the FCC core technologies figure 16-T dipole magnets, based on Nb3                                S                                                  n                 superconductor, for the FCC-hh hadron collider, and a highly-efficient superconducting radiofrequency system for the FCC-ee lepton collider. Following the FCC concept, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Beijing has initiated a parallel design study for an e                                +                                e                                − Higgs factory in China (CEPC), which is to be succeeded by a high-energy hadron collider (SPPC). At present a tunnel circumference of 54 km and a hadron collider c.m. energy of about 70 TeV are being considered. After a brief look at the LHC, this article reports the motivation and the present status of the FCC study, some of the primary design challenges and R{\&}D subjects, as well as the emerging global collaboration.",

The design for a new XUV-Optics Beamline is presented. The collimated plane grating monochromator (PGM-)
beamline at a bending magnet is setup at the BESSY-II synchrotron radiation facility within the framework of the
blazed-grating production facility. Coupled to a versatile four-circle (ten axes) UHV- reflectometer as a permanent end
station the whole setup is dedicated to at-wavelength characterization and calibration of the in-house produced precision
gratings and novel nano-optical devices as well as mirrors, multilayered systems etc. It is also open to external projects
employing reflectometry, spectroscopy or scattering techniques. According to its purpose, this beamline has specific
features, such as: very high spectral purity, provided by two independent high order suppression systems, an advanced
aperture system for suppression of stray light and scattered radiation, a broad energy range between 10 eV and 2000 eV,
small beam divergence and spot size on the sample. Thus this Optics Beamline will become a powerful metrology tool
for reflectivity measurements in s- or p-polarisation geometry with linearly or elliptically polarized light on real optics up
to 360 mm length and 4 kg weight.

Within our technology center for production of highly efficient precision gratings a versatile 4-circle UHV-reflectometer
for synchrotron radiation based at-wavelength characterization has been fabricated. The main feature is the possibility to
incorporate real live-sized gratings. The samples are adjustable within six degrees of freedom by a novel UHV-tripod
system, and the reflectivity can be measured at all incidence angles for both s- and p-polarization geometry. The
reflectometer has been setup in a clean room hutch and it is coupled permanently to the optics beamline PM-1 for the UV
and XUV range with the polarization adjustable to either linear or elliptical. The setup will be open to users by the end of
2014.

abstract = {"Abstract The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented."},

@article{TUP,
	Abstract = {At high energies, beam-induced synchrotron radiation is an important source of heating, beam-related vacuum pressure increase and primary photo-electrons which can give rise to an electron cloud. The photon distribution along the beam pipe wall is a key input to codes as ECLOUD or PyECLOUD, codes which model the electron cloud build-up. For future high-energy colliders, like TLEP or SHE-LHC, photon stops and antechambers are considered in order to facilitate
cooling and vacuum pressure control. We use the synrad3d code developed at Cornell to simulate the distribution for the LHC and compare the result with the cos^2 or cos^3 distributions hitherto employed for LHC electron-cloud studies.
The distribution for the possible future colliders beyond the LHC, like TLEP and SHE-LHC, are also investigated to provide input to the vacuum-system design.},
